# Snake-game

This is the classic snake game that has been remade using Python (no pun intended).

The premise of the game is to control the snake using the arrow keys and eat as much food as possible without hitting any walls or running into yourself. the speed of the snake increases as the snake eats more food, making the game more difficult. The score increases by 10 each time you eat food and grow.

This project was created using:
- Python 3
- Turtle Graphics(Python library)
